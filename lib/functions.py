%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This game is played in a client/server model.
First start the server. Then all clients.
Server is started with play_server - Only once.
Clients are started with play_client. As many as wished.
When (and only when) all clients are connected,
you can enter "c" (without the quotes), on any of the 
clients, to start the game.

Once the game is started, clients send commands to 
move their robot on the map, each at their turn.
Possible commands are:
- mX: build a wall. X is the direction in FR(n,s,e,o)
- pX: build a door. X is the direction in FR(n,s,e,o)
- xX: Move in direction x with X steps
        direction can be n,s,e,o
        step can be any integer
        
Game ends when one of the robots finds the exit or
when one of the clients sends a q command.
